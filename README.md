## Random and Statistically interesting R projects/assignments

## Projects to be synced 

1. Statistical Inference project - 1
	+ Compare a random exponential distribution to a Normal Distribution
	+ Prove that a particular distribution is a Normal Distribution 
	+ Compare the distribution of 1000 random uniforms


2. Statistical Inference project - 2
	+ Analyse the ToothGrowth data 
	+ Do a 	exploratory Data analysis
	+ State conclusions to the fullest
	
3. **Added a Small tool to check MSE using R and Manipulate , with the Help of Coursera DS specialization**
	+ Using the Manipulate library to create the slider with R
	+ Using ggplot2 to plot a histogram of the child heights data from the galton data frame
	+ Using Manipulate to calculate the MSE by calculation of  squared vertical distances for Parent's distribution using y = x(Beta), where Beta is the slope of the equation
	+ Also demonstating what is linear fitting
	
4 ** Adding A descrpiption Linear model Description and the use of the plot(lmfit) function 
	+ Plots showing the residual vs Fitted points | Q-Q normal plots , showing the change (as modeled against) setting + effort
