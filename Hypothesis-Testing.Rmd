```{r setup, include=FALSE,highlight=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Hypothesis Testing
* Always consider that the Null Hypothesis is true , ie H~0 
* Always consider that the predictors/Covariates are not significant for the response under consideration

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
